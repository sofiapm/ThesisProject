\section{Conclusions}
Nowadays the lack of accurate metrics which drives decision-making, makes the achievement of an effective portfolio and operations management a challenge.
This report proposes a new FM benchmarking cloud application for presenting KPIs and a ranking FM organizations. First, was introduced the concepts of FM benchmarking, the problem to be solved by this document solution and the motivation for it. Then, is described with more detail the concepts of FM, Benchmarking, KPIs and Cloud-Computing. Afterwards, is described the different Standards used nationally and internationally, the related work done by other researchers in the field of FM benchmarking, and some technologies existent today in this area. Then, is specified the architecture of the cloud application proposed. Finally it is described how the solution will be evaluated. 

With the solution proposed in this project, quantifying real property performance will be easier and organizations will have a better way to evaluate its own FM metrics, while enabling the comparison of metrics between enterprises and facilities.

%We have to have in account developing a benchmarking strategy selecting only organizations within their own industry to benchmark against \cite{Roka-Madarasz2010}, because comparisons across different categories may estimate the potential that exist for improvement.
